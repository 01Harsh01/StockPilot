## Problem Statement

Every household faces the same invisible problem: **running out of essentials at the worst possible time.**

Families manually track dozens of consumables across pantry, dairy, vegetables, and cleaning supplies. This leads to:
- Frequent stockouts of daily essentials
- Repeated emergency orders at premium prices
- Cognitive load of tracking 40–50 items across multiple family members
- No learning — the same items run out month after month

---

## Solution Overview

**HomeAgent** is an autonomous AI agent system that:

1. **Learns** your household's unique consumption patterns using family size, age groups, diet, and cooking frequency
2. **Predicts** when each item will run out — before it actually does
3. **Builds** optimized shopping carts with best prices, coupons, and substitutes
4. **Orders** automatically (with your approval) from Blinkit, Zepto, Swiggy Instamart, or BigBasket
5. **Improves** over time using a self-learning consumption model

## Key Features

### 🧠 Intelligent Onboarding
- Family composition: adults, elderly, children by age group (infants/toddlers/children/teens)
- Diet type: vegetarian, non-veg, vegan, eggetarian
- Cooking frequency & special dietary needs
- **Consumption multiplier** automatically calculated — a family of 4 adults + 2 children uses ~5.1× more than a single adult

### 📦 Smart Inventory Tracking
- 47 item categories pre-seeded based on household profile and diet
- Real-time stock levels with visual progress bars
- Critical / Low / OK status with color coding
- Days-left prediction for every item

### 🔮 Consumption Prediction
- Machine learning model trained on actual purchase history
- Accounts for guest frequency, seasonal variation, cooking habits
- Recency-weighted retraining via Self-Learning Agent
- Stockout date prediction with urgency scoring

### 🛒 Automated Cart Building
- Pre-built optimized carts with best prices across platforms
- Automatic coupon application (8% on orders ₹400+)
- Smart substitution when preferred brand is out of stock
- Budget-aware — respects per-order and monthly caps

### ✅ Gradual Autonomy Model
| Phase | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| Phase 1 — Alerts | Agent notifies you. You order manually. |
| Phase 2 — Cart Builder | Agent builds cart. You approve with one tap. |
| Phase 3 — Full Auto | Agent orders within budget caps. Notifies after. |

### 📊 Analytics Dashboard
- Weekly spend trends
- Savings breakdown (bulk pricing, coupons, substitutes, price comparison)
- Consumption by category
- Forecast accuracy over time

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| **Frontend** | Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, ES6 Modules |
| **Authentication** | Firebase Auth (Google Sign-In) |
| **Database** | Firebase Firestore (real-time NoSQL) |
| **Agent Engine** | Custom JavaScript multi-agent system |
| **Charts** | Chart.js 4.4 |
| **Deployment** | Netlify (CDN, global edge) |
| **Backend (planned)** | FastAPI + Python for marketplace API integration |
| **ML (planned)** | Prophet / custom time-series models |

**No build tools. No npm. No bundler.** Pure ES modules loaded directly in the browser — deploy anywhere with zero configuration.

## How It Works

### User Journey

```
1. Sign in with Google
        │
        ▼
2. Onboarding (new users only)
   • Household name & city
   • Family: adults + children by age group + elderly + guests
   • Diet type & cooking frequency
   • Preferred platform & budget caps
   • Autonomy level (Phase 1/2/3)
        │
        ▼
3. Dashboard loads
   • Inventory seeded from household profile
   • Agent pipeline runs automatically
   • Live pipeline status shown in UI
        │
        ▼
4. Agents run every 6 hours
   • Inventory Agent scans all items
   • Consumption Agent adjusts rates by family multiplier
   • Prediction Agent forecasts stockout dates
   • Reorder Agent builds cart if items are running low
   • Approval Agent checks autonomy level
   • Shopping Agent places order (Phase 3) or waits for approval
        │
        ▼
5. Self-Learning Agent runs weekly
   • Retrains consumption models from actual purchase history
   • Uses recency-weighted moving average
   • Accounts for guest visits, seasonal changes
```

### Consumption Multiplier Formula

The agent calculates a household multiplier during onboarding:

```
multiplier = adults × 1.0
           + elderly × 0.70
           + infants (0-2) × 0.20
           + toddlers (3-5) × 0.35
           + children (6-12) × 0.55
           + teenagers (13-17) × 0.85
           × guest buffer (0–20%)
           × cook frequency modifier (0.4–1.0)
```

**Example:** 2 adults + 1 toddler + 1 child, often guests, cook daily:
`= (2×1.0) + (1×0.35) + (1×0.55) × 1.12 × 1.0 = **3.25×**`

## Agent Pipeline

```javascript
// js/agents.js — simplified

runAgentPipeline(userId)
  → InventoryAgent.run()       // scan Firestore, flag low/critical
  → ConsumptionAgent.run()     // update weekly usage × multiplier
  → PredictionAgent.run()      // compute daysLeft, stockout dates
  → ReorderAgent.run()         // build optimized cart in Firestore
  → ApprovalAgent.run()        // auto or manual approval
  → ShoppingAgent.run()        // place order, update on delivery
```

## Why This Wins

| Criterion | HomeAgent |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Real problem** | Every Indian household faces stockouts daily |
| **AI-native** | 7 specialized agents, not a CRUD app with AI sprinkled on |
| **Learns** | Self-improving consumption model — gets smarter every week |
| **Privacy-first** | All data in user's own Firestore — no third-party servers |
| **Scalable architecture** | Agent pattern scales from 1 household to 1 million |
